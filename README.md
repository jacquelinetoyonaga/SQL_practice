# SQL_practice
Welcome to my SQL practice space.

You will find the sample_project_queries file containing some code to query the tables in my sample_project_tables file. This was my first project while learning SQL. It consists of various queries to analyze data about people and their hobbies (containing a list of people and a list of their hobbies).

You will find the pizzadb_queries file containing some code to query the tables in my pizzadb file. This was my second project while learning SQL. It consists of various queries to analyze data from an imaginary pizza store database (containing a list of customers, a list of store items, and a list of orders).

I used MySQL Workbench to assist with my learning of SQL.
